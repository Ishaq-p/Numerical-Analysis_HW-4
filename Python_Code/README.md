# HW#4 from Numerical Analysis
## the method that i am required to use are FPI, Newton's, Secant, and Regular Falsi methods.
## NOTE: 
### in this repo you won't find any quistion and answer templates, this repo is only made for storing the codes that will perform the methods i mentioned above
### unless i add my or my peer's assignments

## WARNINGS!
### -> the Relative Error part of the methods in output are not rounded, so that's on you, you have to do it on your own since i had some difficulty in getting the rounded values of RE, unless i find a way to solve that error.
### -> if you come accross values like 3.42323499999999, all you have to do is round them to your desired rounding digits; or may be it's something like this 4.432321000000004, you suppose to apply the above statement here too.

# GOOD LUCK!!
